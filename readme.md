# Reinforcement Approach to Data Harvesting Problem
## Folder Organization
> assets: contains all the results  

> configs: contains configuration files for RL algorithm and data transmittion model  

> environments:
>> configs: the general simulator instances
>> instances: the simulator
>>> loader: batch load of instances

> trainer: contains RL algorithms 

> utils: helper functions

## Braches
> Optimal Path: Using Deep Reinforcement Learning to minimize the data harvesting time of a single agent in 2D with multiple targets.
